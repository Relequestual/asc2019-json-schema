## Matchmaker Exchange API

 - Siloed databases of patient data
   - <small>(including DNA variants)</small>
 - Rare and undiagnosed cases
   - <small>(> 10 per country rare)</small>
 - Complex logal and ethical situation
 - Discover and exchange pateint data

</ContentLayout>

<Notes>
  I'm going to walk through what it might have been like to create a JSON Schema for this API.

  The MME API is a federated search (for similar) and response of potential matches using a patient record.

  Not going to cover the legal, social, or ethical issues. Be assured they were handled properly.

  Today is about the technical.

## Matchmaker Exchange API

- Each database holds slightly different data
- Representation of a patient needs to be uniform
- Write specification using words and examples
- Release v1.0!

## Sounds easy, right?

# Requirements for queries

- Root object has a 'patient'
- 'patient' must have
